In	O

Our	O

estimate	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
we	O
show	O
that	O
this	O
leads	O
to	O
a	O
model	O
of	O
computational	O

whereby	O
an	O
agent	O
must	O
determine	O
a	O

that	O
represent	O
the	O

that	O
any	O

We	O
present	O
a	O
formalism	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
Dirichlet	B

that	O
allows	O
an	O
agent	O
to	O
calculate	O
these	O

and	O
correlations	B
from	O
their	O
direct	O
experience	O
of	O

outcomes	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
show	O
that	O
this	O
leads	O
to	O
superior	O

to	O
an	O
alternative	O
approach	O
using	O
multiple	O

We	O

how	O

We	O

We	O

This	O
